# swarm_sim

More accurately a shoal/school simulator.

Uses the [3 principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoaling_and_schooling#Mathematical_models) of shoal behaviour to simulate the evolution of a shoal over time.

1. Move in the same direction as your neighbours
2. Remain close to your neighbours
3. Avoid collisions with your neighbours
